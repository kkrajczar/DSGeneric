# ARIMA

ARIMA is a time series forecasting model. It has three components: an auto-regression (AR) term, an "integrated" (I) term, and a moving average (MA) term. ARIMA is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model.

The AR part of ARIMA indicates that the evolving variable of interest is regressed on its own lagged (i.e., prior) values. The MA part indicates that the regression error is actually a linear combination of error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The I indicates that the data values have been replaced with the difference between their values and the previous values to remove non-stationarity.
